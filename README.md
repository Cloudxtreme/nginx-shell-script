This is Bash Script for using Nginx commands from CLI. 

While compiling Nginx in some systems the shell doesn't recognize nginx as a process, so, installing this bash script users can use Nginx via CLI.

## Installation

Just copy the file [Nginx](/nginx-shell-script/init.d/nginx) to the /etc/init.d/ folder of your system.
